## Introduction

SimGBS is a versatile method of simulating  [Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019379) data. It can be implemented with any genome of choice. Users can modify different parameters to customise GBS setting, such as the choice of [restriction enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme#Examples) and [sequencing depth](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3642). By taking the [gene-drop](https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/5/7/1415/6025367) approach, users can also specify the demographic history and define population structure (by supplying a pedigree file). Like real sequencers, SimGBS will output data into [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format.   

## Installation

`SimGBS.jl` is registered in the [`General`](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) registry. It can be installed using `Pkg.add`,

```julia
julia> import Pkg;Pkg.add("SimGBS")
```

or simply

```julia
julia> ] 
pkg> add SimGBS
```


## Input

- Reference genome of the target species in FASTA format (e.g., `xxx.fasta.gz`/`xxx.fa.gz`)   

- A list of Illumina barcodes (e.g., `GBS_Barcodes.txt`)

- (optional) Pedigree File (e.g.,`small.ped`)



## Output

- GBS fragments generated by virtual digestion (e.g.,`rawGBStags.txt`)

- Selected GBS fragments after fragment size-selection (e.g.,`GBStags.txt`)

- Haplotypes, SNP and QTL genotypes (e.g.,`hap.txt`, `snpGeno.txt` and `qtlGeno.txt`)

- Basic information about simulated GBS experiment (e.g.,`keyFile.txt`)

- Simulated GBS reads in FASTQ format (e.g.,`xxxxx.fastq`)

etc.

## What's Next?

The following tools are recommended for downstream analyses of GBS data,

- [**snpGBS**](https://github.com/AgResearch/snpGBS): a simple bioinformatics workflow to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) data.

- [**KGD**](https://github.com/AgResearch/KGD): R code for the analysis of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data, primarily to construct a genomic relationship matrix for the genotyped individuals.   

- [**GUSLD**](https://github.com/AgResearch/GUS-LD): An R package for estimating linkage disequilibrium using low and/or high coverage sequencing data without requiring filtering with respect to read depth.

- [**SMAP**](https://gitlab.com/truttink/smap) a software package that analyzes read mapping distributions and performs haplotype calling to create multi-allelic molecular markers.
